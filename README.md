# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis with NLP

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text data (such as tweets, reviews, or comments) as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

The goal is to analyze the emotion or opinion behind textual data using machine learning models.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw text data
- Convert text to numerical format using **TF-IDF / CountVectorizer**
- Train a classification model (e.g., **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, or **SVM**)
- Predict the sentiment of new/unseen text
- Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like **confusion matrix**, **precision**, and **recall**

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy (for NLP tasks)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Data Cleaning: Stopword removal, lowercasing, stemming/lemmatization
2. Feature Extraction: Text converted to vectors
3. Model Training: Using ML classifiers
4. Evaluation: Accuracy and performance report
5. Prediction: Run the model on custom input text

## 💬 Sample Input & Output

- **Input**: "I love this product! It works great."
- **Output**: Positive 😊

- **Input**: "The service was terrible and slow."
- **Output**: Negative 😞

## 📈 Possible Applications

- Social Media Monitoring
- Product/Service Feedback Analysis
- Customer Support Automation
- Movie/Product Review Classification
